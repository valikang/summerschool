## Vector module

The file [vec.F90](vec.F90) contains a simple user
interface for a program that performs basic operations for vectors
given by the user (here 3D vectors for simplicity). 

Your task is to implement functions for calculating the following operations:

- vector length (norm)
- summation and subtraction between two vectors
- dot product and vector (cross) product between two vectors

Overload them to match with the syntax in vec.F90. Placeholders for these are in [vecmod.F90](vecmod.F90).
